    <p>This meal is a special meal, because it's a meal that is meant to nurture,
        and strengthen something I hold dear; my brain. The colene and omega 3's
        in this meal, when eaten regularly will turn your brain into a powerhouse
        of thinking and learning capability. Simple, but potent. As it should be</p>
