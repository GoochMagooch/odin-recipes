    <h1>Steak Pasta - A Single Guy's Take on a Family Favorite</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium ribeye steak</li>
        <li>1 lb of penne pasta</li>
        <li>1 jar of quality pasta sauce</li>
        <li>garlic powder</li>
        <li>onion powder</li>
        <li>salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin heating a pot full of water - enough to cover the pasta</li>
        <li>While the water is getting up to a boil, slice the ribeye steak into
            pieces at about half an inch each</li>
        <li>Place the steak pieces into a ziploc bag that contains 2 tablespoons
            of each seasoning. Shake vigorously and let sit</li>
        <li>Once the water is at a rolling boil, add pasta until fully cooked</li>
        <li>Drain pasta, saving about a cup of pasta water, and add olive oil so
            the pasta doesn't stick to each other. Place pasta in a separate bowl
            to sit while we prepare the sauce</li>
        <li>Place the same pot on the stove to get ripping hot then add the steak
            with a little bit of olive oil</li>
        <li>Allow the steak to get light brown, with some pieces crusting up a
            little bit. Just don't cook the pieces to well done</li>
        <li>Add pasta water & pasta sauce and let simmer for 10 minutes, or until
            the water has cooked out enough and the sauce is fairly thick</li>
        <li>Add the pasta into the pot of pasta sauce, add another tablespoon of
            each seasoning to the sauce, stir and enjoy with some parmesan cheese
            on top</li>
    </ol>
