    <h1>Steak Pasta - A Single Guy's Take on a Family Favorite</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium ribeye steak</li>
        <li>1 lb of penne pasta</li>
        <li>24oz of plain tomato sauce</li>
        <li>8oz can of tomato paste</li>
        <li>3 large cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>garlic powder</li>
        <li>onion powder</li>
        <li>salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin heating a pot full of water - enough to cover the pasta</li>
        <li>While the water is getting up to a boil, slice the ribeye steak into
            pieces at about half an inch each</li>
        <li>Place the steak pieces into a ziploc bag that contains 2
            <abbr title="tablespoons">tbsp</abbr> of each seasoning. Shake
            vigorously and let sit
        </li>
        <li>Chop garlic cloves</li>
        <li>Once the water is at a rolling boil, add pasta until fully cooked</li>
        <li>Drain pasta, saving about a cup of pasta water, and drizzle olive oil on
            the so the pasta doesn't stick to each other. Place pasta in a separate
            bowl while we prepare the sauce</li>
        <li>Place the same pot on the stove to get ripping hot then add some olive
            oil and the chopped garlic. Cook the garlic until it's golden brown</li>
        <li>Add the steak pieces and allow the steak to get light brown, with some
            pieces crusting up a little bit. Just don't cook the pieces to well
            done</li>
        <li>Add the tomato <strong>paste</strong> and pasta water and stir until
            most of the water is cooked out of the sauce. Then add the remaining
            tomato sauce and stir until the sauce thickens</li>
        <li>Add the pasta into the pot of pasta sauce, add another <abbr title="tablespoons">tbsp</abbr>
            of each seasoning to the sauce, stir and enjoy with some parmesan
            cheese on top</li>
    </ol>
